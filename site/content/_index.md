# Welcome to Gdmod

A Garry's Mod styled sandbox and playground built in the powerful Godot engine. This is a **learning experience project** by [@JostGrant](https://github.com/jostgrant) to explore game development, sandbox mechanics, and the Godot engine.

Create, experiment, and play in an open-world environment while following along with the development journey!
