    <h1>Godot Sandbox / Playground</h1>
</div>

This is an experimental, exploratory project towards a "physics / creative sandbox" game in Godot (In the ballpark of Gmod, Onset, Etc). This is allso a learning experience for [Jost Grant](https://github.com/jostgrant) to learn Godot in-general. So expect things to be weird, wonky, and broken for the forseeable future. lol

# The Goal
To have a `fully` 'live, moddable' session. Basically to be able to load anything / everything into the running instance.
